The AutoComplete widget provides a flexible, configurable, and accessible implementation of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/selection/autocomplete.html">AutoComplete design pattern</a>, which offers suggestions or provides some other form of filtering or completion as a user types text in an input field.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the core logic for filtering and completion, AutoComplete also provides options for custom filtering, highlighting, and formatting of results; delimited queries; result retrieval from a variety of local and remote sources including <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a>, JSONP, and XHR; and more.
</p>

<p>
AutoComplete is also built to be modular and easy to extend so that it can be used as the basis for custom implementations and widgets.

<h2>Using AutoComplete</h2>
<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>
In a hurry? Here's how to get up and running with AutoComplete in just a few lines of code. The following examples demonstrate how to use AutoComplete with several common result sources. Pick the one that most closely matches your needs (you only need one!).
</p>

```
YUI().use('autocomplete', 'autocomplete-highlighters', function (Y) {

  // Add the yui3-skin-sam class to the body so the default
  // AutoComplete widget skin will be applied.
  Y.one('body').addClass('yui3-skin-sam');

  // The following examples demonstrate some of the different
  // result sources AutoComplete supports. You only need to
  // pick one, you don't need them all. Assume the '#ac-input'
  // element id used in this example refers to an <input>
  // element on the page.

  // Array source. Replace the example array with any array.
  Y.one('#ac-input').plug(Y.Plugin.AutoComplete, {
    resultHighlighter: 'phraseMatch',
    source: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  });

  // YQL source. Leave the {query} placeholder as is; AutoComplete
  // will replace it automatically.
  Y.one('#ac-input').plug(Y.Plugin.AutoComplete, {
    resultHighlighter: 'phraseMatch',
    source: 'select * from search.suggest where query="{query}"'
  });

  // JSONP URL source. Leave the {query} and {callback} placeholders
  // as is; AutoComplete will replace them automatically.
  Y.one('#ac-input').plug(Y.Plugin.AutoComplete, {
    resultHighlighter: 'phraseMatch',
    source: 'http://example.com/search.jsonp?q={query}&callback={callback}'
  });

  // XHR URL source (no callback). Leave the {query} placeholder
  // as is; AutoComplete will replace it automatically.
  Y.one('#ac-input').plug(Y.Plugin.AutoComplete, {
    resultHighlighter: 'phraseMatch',
    source: 'http://example.com/search.json?q={query}'
  });

});
```
